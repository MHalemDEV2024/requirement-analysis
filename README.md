# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to exploring the requirement analysis phase in the software development lifecycle. It provides a structured approach to documenting, analyzing, and organizing software requirements, forming the foundation for successful project planning and implementation.

Through a simulated real-world case study, this project aims to enhance understanding of:
- Requirements gathering techniques
- Functional and non-functional requirement documentation
- Use case modeling
- Requirement validation and management

The goal is to demonstrate best practices and methodologies that ensure clarity, completeness, and alignment with stakeholder expectations.
